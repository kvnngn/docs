## Overview

BETiq provides a RESTful API that allows you to programmatically access and manipulate data, create dashboards, and manage analytics workflows. All API endpoints require proper authentication.

## Authentication Methods

BETiq supports multiple authentication methods to ensure secure access to your data and resources.

### Bearer Token Authentication

The primary authentication method uses Bearer tokens for API access.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://api.betiq.loreal.com/v1/data
```

### API Key Authentication

For service-to-service communication, you can use API keys in the request header.

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://api.betiq.loreal.com/v1/analytics
```

## Getting Your Credentials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact Administrator">
    Reach out to your BETiq system administrator to request API access credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Specify Permissions">
    Define the specific resources and operations you need access to (read, write, admin).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Credentials">
    You'll receive your API token or key along with usage guidelines.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication Headers

Include the appropriate authentication header in all API requests:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Bearer Token
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

```bash API Key
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

```bash Content Type (Required)
Content-Type: application/json
```
</CodeGroup>

## Rate Limits

API requests are subject to rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **Standard**: 1000 requests per hour
- **Premium**: 5000 requests per hour
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

<Warning>
  Exceeding rate limits will result in HTTP 429 responses. Implement exponential backoff in your applications.
</Warning>

## Error Handling

Authentication errors return specific status codes:

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `401` | Invalid or missing credentials |
| `403` | Insufficient permissions |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded |

## Security Best Practices

  <Card title="Rotation Policy" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Regularly rotate your API credentials (recommended: every 90 days)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Principle of Least Privilege" icon="user-lock">
    Request only the minimum permissions needed for your use case
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secure Transport" icon="lock">
